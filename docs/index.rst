**Scikit Emperical Dynamic Modeling**

Scikit Emperical Dynamic Modeling (skedm) can be used as a way to forecast time series, spatio-temporal 2D arrays, and even discrete spatial arrangements. More importantly, skedm can provide insight into the underlying dynamics of a system. For a more complete background, I suggest checking out `Nonlinear Analysis by Kantz`_ as well as `Practical implementation of nonlinear time series methods: The TISEAN package`_. This package reproduces some of the tisean package in pure python. For a brief overview, the wikipedia article on `nonlinear analysis`_ is a good start. Additionally, `Dr. Sugihara's lab`_ has produced some good summary videos of the topic:

1. `Time Series and Dynamic Manifolds`_
2. `Reconstructed Shadow Manifold`_
