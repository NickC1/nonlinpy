This work resulted from the Reefs Tomorrow Intiative funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. I would also like to thank Dr. Dylan McNamara for continous feedback and for introducing me to emperical dynamic modeling. I would also like to thank Dr. Kenneth Ells and the rest of the `CASL`_ group for proofreading and testing this package.
