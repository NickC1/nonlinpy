[DOCUMENTATION][read-the-docs]

Scikit Empirical Dynamic Modeling (skedm) can be used as a way to forecast time series, spatio-temporal 2D or 3D arrays, and even discrete spatial arrangements. More importantly, skedm can provide insight into the underlying dynamics of a system, specifically whether a system is nonlinear and deterministic or whether it is dominated by noise.

For a quick explanation of this package, I suggest checking the wikipedia article on [nonlinear analysis][nonlinear-wiki] . Additionally, [Dr. Sugihara's lab][sugihara-lab] has produced some good summary videos of the topic:

1. [Time Series and Dynamic Manifolds][vid-1]
2. [Reconstructed Shadow Manifold][vid-2]


For a more complete background, I suggest checking out [Nonlinear Analysis by Kantz][kantz] as well as [Practical implementation of nonlinear time series methods: The TISEAN package][tisean]
